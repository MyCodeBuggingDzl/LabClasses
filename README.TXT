Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling
   Pearson Education

It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

30: Int is use to represent whole numbers whithout any decimales. String is use to apply a code or a value.

“hello”  = string
101  = int
-1     = int
true   = int

3.1415  = int

32: If you want to name an object for exemple name the circle "sun", sun = new circle.

33: public void send(string)

34: pubic int average(int a, int b)

35: My book is an object and its class would be a book. Because a class describes the object while the object represent its proporties to the class.

   36: No, an object doesn't belong to multiple class, however the object will have the same properties as the class it doesn't belong to. It's like species of a older generation, its class is new but it has some feature similar to another class.
